This configure files is written by ES Modules. I don't use TypeScript in this case because it must conflict loaded projects.

## Problem

GitHub pages doesn't support image files.

[staticDirs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/main-config-static-dirs) is a good solution, but it is impossible because in this case, we wanna use GitHub's asset files as example â˜ž https://github.com/casaub0n/casaub0n/blob/main/apps/casaub0n-page/public/images/me.jpg?raw=true

so it must use regular expression.
