This project is my Next.js boilerplate.

## Type in package.json

```console
 ⨯ Failed to load next.config.js, see more info here https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/next-config-error

> Build error occurred
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/home/runner/work/***/***/apps/***-page/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.

```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
