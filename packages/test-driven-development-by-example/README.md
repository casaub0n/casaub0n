# Test Driven Development By Example
- the author: Kent Beck

This project implemented example codes by TypeScript.

## Problem
In money package, each modules uses Factory method, but it occurs the technical issue about circular reference.
In addition, the actual error message is `TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null`

## Solution
Still WIP: https://jestjs.io/ja/docs/ecmascript-modules
