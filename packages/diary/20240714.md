# Sonatine

After my work, I went to [Shin Bunngeiza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vsa2znSb1zTuWjdbA) to watch the film that's [Sonatine](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0108188/).

The director and the main character's actor is Kitano Takeshi, very hardboiled fiction.

I choosed Tukemenn style mini Buta, Buta means pork, and then I ordered Yasai Mashimashi that's means vegetable is more as NINNIKU call
